### Facebook AI Blog: [Link](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-can-now-emulate-text-style-in-images-in-one-shot-using-just-a-single-word/)
- an AI research project that can copy the style of text in a photo using just a single word. With this AI model, you can edit and replace text in images.
- TextStyleBrush is the first self-supervised AI model that replaces text in images of both handwriting and scenes — in one shot — using a single example word.
- Although this is a research project, it could one day unlock new potential for creative self-expression like personalized messaging and captions, 
and lays the groundwork for future innovations like photo-realistic translation of languages in augmented reality (AR).
