### [AndroidEnv](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/androidenv) : The Android Learning Environment
### [Github link](https://github.com/deepmind/android_env)
-  Reinforcement Learning(RL) on Android ecosystem.
-  **AndroidEnv allows RL agents to interact with a wide variety of apps and services commonly used by humans through a universal touchscreen interface.**
-   AndroidEnv, a platform that allows agents to interact with an Android device and solve custom tasks built on top of the Android OS
-   AndroidEnv, an agent makes decisions based on images displayed on the screen, and navigates the interface through touchscreen actions and gestures just like humans.
-   With access to the entire Android OS, the set of possible services and applications with which the agent could interact is virtually unlimited.
-   For example, an agent might browse the internet, open the YouTube app, set an alarm or play a game

### AndroidEnv: Environment Features: 
-  Real Time Environment : AndroidEnv is built on top of an emulated Android device, allowing the agent to communicate with the emulator through touch actions.
-  Action Space: Large and complex action space
-  Gesture: scrolling, left swipe, pressing buttons,
-  Observation Space: AndroidEnv is built on top of an emulated Android device, allowing the agent to communicate with the emulator through touch actions.

### AndroidEnv - Running the environment
-  two components are required: 1. Simulator 2. Task
-  A task is a particular definition of an RL problem that the agent will be interacting with
-
